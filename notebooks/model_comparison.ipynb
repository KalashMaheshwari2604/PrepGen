The proposed methodology addresses privacy concerns in healthcare data analysis by enabling collaborative model training without centralizing sensitive patient information. Our experiments demonstrate a 23% improvement in model accuracy while maintaining strict privacy guarantees through differential privacy mechanisms. We also provide theoretical analysis of the privacy-utility tradeoff and discuss practical considerations for deployment in clinical settings.\n",
